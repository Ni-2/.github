Dapplets Project is an open-source Augmented Web platform for building decentralized applications (dapplets), powered by crypto technologies.

These dapplets work on top of traditional websites but augment them to serve new purposes, realize new workflows, and add novel features without taking the user out of his usual context.

Augmented web’s concept of decentralization is applied not just to the servers, but also to the UI and UX levels.

This makes dapplets unstoppable, permissionless, censorship-resistant and decentralized.

Augmented Web gives the users freedom, new experiences, business opportunities and allows them to become self-sovereign.

## Our mission:

- To provide you with a toolset for shaping your own information ecosystem.

- To enable fundamentally new workflows on popular websites.

- To provide web3 technologies on the legacy web.

- To restore the freedom to receive information without censorship or manipulation.

Together we can give the economy and users new business models that are currently unattainable.

Our system is open-source and available to developers anywhere in the world. 

We invite developers to become part of our community and contribute to the development of the Augmented Web.
